- simple command/query pattern by defining input class, results class and handler
- using entity framework dbcontext as unit of work, not fighting it with repositories 
- using IoC (autofac) for decopling commands from controllers by exposing simple command dispatcher
- unit and integration testing is simple as it gets, define inputs > execute command > verify outputs
